            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
            Croissants are named for its historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered
            yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled
            into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
            puff pastry.
